The main purpose of this website is to teach various concepts of Agile Programming, SCRUM, KanBan and Extreme Programming in the interactive way. As part of a teaching process we will develop various interactive games to manage project, learn optimised team handling, team co-ordination and maximised use of resources. We encourage learner to play these games, and during playing session he/she will find various potential problems and bottle-necking which may arise in any real world project. Each game will have different levels of difficulty and each difficulty level will either enhance your existing knowledge or will encapsulate different strategies.

This is the first game of the series. Rules of game are very simple:

    Start a new game by clicking a button “New Game” on top left corner.
    Each team will have a set of dices.
    Each team will have random number of tasks in the backlog.
    Each task will take random number of work units to finish.
    The task with number 5 means it can be finished in 5 units of work.
    Tasks will move from “Backlog” to “Work in Progress” to “Done” state.
    Each team will roll dices by clicking “Roll Dice” button.
    The dice with number 1, is distinct from other dices in colour.
    The dice with number 1, represents one unit of work and is draggable within its team.
    Drag the dice with number 1, to any of the task and notice changes.
    If there is no dice with number 1, then click “Roll Dice” button.
    The “Roll Dice” button is disabled if there are one or more dices with number 1.
    The “Roll Dice” button is automatically enabled, once all dices with number 1 are dragged to tasks.
    Once the task is in Done column player will need to use dice with number 1 to push it to the backlog of the next team or in the Finished column (in case of last team).
    As a player your job is to finish maximum tasks possible and keep the consistent velocity.
